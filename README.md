Updates
============

 - Now you can Change the BAUD of the camara; it does not increase the performance significantly, but it is available and may be useful
 - Now you can Connect your Camera directly to the Edison mini-breakout board without the need of the Arduino Board!
 - Now you can Change the compression Ratio 
  - I tried to change the ratio in the range specified by the manufacturer but the camera refuses to do so; anyways the option to change it is there altough the camera will just ignore it.
 - Check out the RUN_EXAMPLE.txt so you can take a look at what you should be seeing when you run the **main.c** sample code
 - Now you can get the 3 available resolutions 640x480, 320x240 and 160x120
 - Now you can export the content to a buffer or directly to a jpeg file
 - You can print your buffer to a jpeg file
 - I will soon explain the Returns of the functions; in simple words, if you get a 0 return, everything's fine. I will add this information soon.

Coming Next
============

### There will be some extra modifications and documentation

 - Function to Change Baud
 - Function to Change Ratio
 - Function to Change Resolution
 - Function to Activate Power Saving Mode
 - Explanation of the function Returns
 - Getting Started with the Arduino Expansion Board
 - Getting Started with the Mini Breakout Board

Arduino Board Setup
============
In order to make this code work with your Arduino Breakout Board, you will need to consider several steps:
 - Even though you will use your Arduino Board, you will program it using the Linux Terminal
- The easy way to activate the Serial Port to communicate with the camera is running this Arduino Sketch:
```sh
void setup() 
{  
       Serial1.begin(38400); 
}  
void loop() 
{  
       delay(1000);      
}  
```
 - Add the **C Folder** files to a directory of your preference within the Edison (Yocto)
 - Between the RX and TX of your camera and the Arduino's connect a 10K resistor
 - Power your Camera with a separate Power Source since the Arduino Breakout Limits the Current
 - You can power it with your computer using a normal USB cable
 - Cut the USB Cable and you will see 4 cables (you will only use the Red and Black)
  - Be carefull not to connect the other 2 cables
 - Connect the RedUSB cable to the 5V pin of the camera
 - Connect the BlackUSB cable to the Ground pin of the camera and to the Arduino Ground

 - Compile the code:
```sh
 gcc main.c -o main.out
```
 - Run the code:
```sh
 chmod +x main.out
 ./main.out
```
 - You will see that this **main** will output 6 fotos, the first one of each pair is created by printing the array that contains the photo, and the second one by printing directly to the file with no user-created array

Mini-Breakout Setup
============
In order to make this code work with your Mini-Breakout Board, you will need to consider several steps:
- You need to keep in mind that you MUST use a Level Shifter. The one that I used was: [Texas Instruments TXB0108 8-Bit Bidirectional Voltage-Level Translator](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/txb0108.pdf)
- The easy way to activate the Serial Port to communicate with the camera is running this Arduino Sketch (This only needs to be run once! It will get rid of the extra **end-of-line** character sent from the camera to the Edison. After the reboot it should keep its configuration)
```sh
void setup() 
{  
       Serial1.begin(38400); 
}  
void loop() 
{  
       delay(1000);      
}  
```
 - Add the **C Folder** files to a directory of your preference within the Edison (Yocto)
 - Make sure you follow these connections (The IC shows a Level shifter; it supposes that you have the right Capacitors and Resistors connected to make it work properly)

 - Here is one example of the [level shifter](https://hetpro-store.com/convertidor-de-niveles-logicos-bidireccional-level-shifter-8ch/) used for this tutorial
 - Compile the code:
```sh
 gcc main.c -o main.out
```
 - Run the code:
```sh
 chmod +x main.out
 ./main.out
```
 - You will see that this **main** will output 6 fotos, the first one of each pair is created by printing the array that contains the photo, and the second one by printing directly to the file with no user-created array
